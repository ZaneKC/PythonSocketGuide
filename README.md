# PythonSocketGuide
This is my experience with the Python module Socket, documented and explained. In this guide i utilize Tkinter in my scripts to get the best result from Socket. Socket is a low-level networking interface. It is not designed for extreme activity or high packet transmission. In my experience, Socket is a great tool to use for learning how basic servers function and low level penetration/middle man attack testing.
**This is a dynamic guide. I am actively working to improve the guide, as I am learning more about Python and its modules everyday.**
